# LabelleOS
# LabelleOS is a computer program written in python designed to look and feel like a terminal based operating system. It's main focus is to teach people who aren't knowledgeable about tech. We do this by recreating many of the commands that you will find in any terminal/command-line, such as Crosh, Linux, any random linux distro that you can make up, window command prompt, to name a few. By the end of this "course" or "lesson" you will be able to sit down at any computer and know what to do. LabelleOS is free for all to use and is community driven and developed. You can even get add ons for LabelleOS
